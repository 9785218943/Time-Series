    "Handling Missing Values:\n",

    "De-Seasonalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove seasonality from the data to better identify underlying patterns. This often involves differencing the data by subtracting the value from the same season in the previous year.\n",
    "Normalization/Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scale the data to ensure that different features are on a similar scale. Common methods include Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.\n",
    "Handling Outliers:\n",

    "Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create new features that may enhance the analysis. For instance, generating lag features (values from previous time steps) can capture temporal dependencies.\n",

    "Ensure that the time series is stationary if required by the chosen analysis technique. Stationarity means that the statistical properties of the time series (mean, variance, etc.) do not change over time. Techniques like differencing or logarithmic transformations can be used.\n",

    "Assumption: The time series should be stationary, meaning that its statistical properties (such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation) do not change over time.\n",

    "Assumption: The relationships between the time series and its lagged values, as well as the residuals, should be linear.\n",
    "Testing: Examination of residual plots and statistical tests for linearity can be performed. Nonlinear patterns in residuals may indicate violations of this assumption.\n",
    "Independence of Residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) should be independent and not exhibit any patterns or trends.\n",
    "Testing: Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots of residuals can help detect any remaining patterns. The Ljung-Box test is a formal statistical test for residual independence.\n",

    "Steps for Testing Assumptions in Practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Inspection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine time series plots, ACF, PACF, and residual plots visually to identify any patterns, trends, or abnormalities.\n",
    "Statistical Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize formal statistical tests to assess stationarity, independence, linearity, and normality. Common tests include the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity, the Ljung-Box test for residual independence, and the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality.\n",
    "Residual Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the residuals from the ARIMA model. A good ARIMA model should result in residuals that appear random and have constant variance.\n",
    "Outlier Detection:\n",

    "Limitations of Time Series Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationarity Assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many time series models, including ARIMA, assume stationarity, meaning that the statistical properties of the series do not change over time. In practice, achieving and maintaining stationarity can be challenging.\n",
    "Model Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some time series patterns may be too complex to be accurately captured by traditional models. Overly complex models may lead to overfitting, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns.\n",
    "Data Quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series analysis is highly sensitive to data quality. Missing values, outliers, or measurement errors can impact the accuracy of forecasts.\n",
    "Nonlinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional time series models, such as ARIMA, assume linear relationships. Nonlinear patterns or abrupt changes in the underlying process may not be adequately captured.\n",
    "Limited Forecast Horizon:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series models are generally suitable for short to medium-term forecasting. Extrapolating far into the future may result in less reliable predictions.\n",
    "External Factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series models may struggle to account for external factors or shocks that significantly impact the data but are not part of the modeled time series.\n",
    "Dependency on Historical Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series models heavily rely on historical data. Sudden changes in the underlying process that were not present in the historical data may lead to inaccurate forecasts."

    "Definition: A time series is considered stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, remain constant over time.\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "The mean and variance do not exhibit significant trends or fluctuations over different time intervals.\n",

    "How Stationarity Affects the Choice of Forecasting Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationary Time Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of Model: Stationary time series are suitable for traditional time series models like ARIMA.\n",
    "Advantages: These models assume stationarity, making the modeling process straightforward. Differencing is often unnecessary, and the model can capture autoregressive and moving average components more effectively.\n",
    "Non-Stationary Time Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of Model: Non-stationary time series may require transformations to achieve stationarity before applying traditional models.\n",
    "Advantages: Seasonal decomposition, differencing, or other transformations can be applied to make the time series stationary. Once stationarity is achieved, ARIMA or SARIMA models can be employed.\n",
    "Impact of Non-Stationarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-stationarity poses challenges for time series analysis and forecasting. Common issues include difficulty in identifying patterns, unstable means and variances, and the violation of assumptions in traditional models.\n",
    "Steps to Handle Non-Stationarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Differencing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply differencing to remove trends and achieve stationarity. Differencing involves subtracting consecutive observations.\n",
    "Detrending:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use methods like polynomial fitting or moving averages to remove trends.\n",
    "Seasonal Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components to identify and remove seasonality.\n",
    "Logarithmic Transformation:\n",
